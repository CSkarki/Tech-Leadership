# ISO 27001 Certification Program – Enterprise Audit Readiness

## 🔍 Summary
This case study outlines the successful execution of a full-scale ISO 27001 audit-readiness and certification program. I led cross-functional teams in implementing risk control measures, aligning processes with security standards, and driving enterprise compliance efforts across technical and operational domains.

## 🚨 Problem → 💡 Solution → 📈 Impact

### Problem
CIBT faced increasing pressure from global clients and partners to meet formal information security standards. However, internal processes lacked structured risk tracking, and InfoSec policies were inconsistently applied across programs.

### Solution
- Initiated and chaired a cross-functional **Risk Control Board** for risk visibility and mitigation planning.
- Mapped internal systems and projects to ISO 27001 control families (A.5 to A.18).
- Aligned Agile program tracking (RAID logs, retrospectives) with **ISMS objectives**.
- Led collaboration between IT, legal, and compliance teams for audit documentation and controls validation.

### Impact
- 🏆 Achieved ISO 27001 certification in under 9 months.
- 🚨 Reduced risk exposure with 75% fewer audit findings year-over-year.
- 📁 Established a living ISMS framework and internal compliance playbook.
- 🔁 Created repeatable patterns now used by legal and security for future audits.
